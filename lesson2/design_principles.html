    <img src="images/small1.png" alt="Example of proximity principal in practise">
    <p>The prnciple of proximity is the practise of placing
        related items of a page in a visually appealing way 
        and reduce clutter and producing a more organised layout.

        This is best achieved by placing items related to each other closer
        while those unrelated are placed further apart.

        On my image example, the log, menu and other links are in close proximity with each other 
        while the item which is being offered or the product on sale is on its own location, making it 
        outstandiing to users.

    <img src="images/small.png" alt="Visual hsierarchy example">
    <p>Visual Hierarchy of a display refers to the organisation
        of the design elements on the page so that eye is guided to see what is 
        of great importance or need to be attended first. This  may include
        sign in buttons or the company's log.

        On the example of my image, the first out standing features is the form asking 
        for the user to enter their login details in order to use the page.

    <img src="images/small2.png" alt="Example of whitespace design principels">
    
    
    <p>The white space rule is a design practise where the designer 
        ensures that the elements on the page can breath. Accurate use of 
        clean design pleases the user.

        On my image example, every element is outstanding which
        l also felt as a pulling factor making users to have a desire 
        of using the page and find out more about what is being offered.
